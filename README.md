### Prerequisites

- A running Plex Media Server
- Valid Plex token and TMDB API key
- Docker or an Unraid environment with the Community Applications plugin installed

### Using Unraid (Community Applications)

1. Open the Community Applications plugin in your Unraid dashboard.
2. Search for **Plex Poster Updater**.
3. Click **Install** and follow the on-screen instructions.

### Using Docker

1. Pull the project image from Docker Hub:

   ```bash
   docker pull vwdewaal/plex_poster_updater:latest
   ```

2. Run the container:

   ```bash
   docker run -d \
     --name=plexposterupdater \
     -p 5000:5000 \
     -e PLEX_API_KEY=your_plex_api_key \
     -e TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key \
     vwdewaal/plex_poster_updater:latest
   ```

3. Replace `your_plex_api_key` and `your_tmdb_api_key` with your secret keys to enable communication with Plex and TMDB.

## Configuration

After installation, configuration is straightforward:

1. **Access the Interface:**  
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://<YOUR_SERVER_IP>:5000`.

2. **Enter API Keys:**  
   Input your [X-Plex-Token] and TMDB API key. These keys allow the updater to access your Plex server data and fetch the correct movie posters from TMDB.

3. **Set Plex Server Details:**  
   Provide your Plex Media Server URL (for example, `http://192.168.1.50:32400` and X-Plex-Token).

4. **Select Your Library:**  
   Specify the name of the movie library you wish to update. Your Plex library might be labeled as `Movies`, `Films`, or another custom name.

5. **Choose a Search Method:**  
   - **Text Search:** Enter part of a movieâ€™s title (e.g., entering "day" might find "Glory Days", "Groundhog Day", "Independence Day", etc.).
   - **Time-based Filter:** Filter by the date the movies were added (last week, last two weeks, etc.).  
   
6. **Update Posters:**  
   Check the boxes next to the movies you want to update and hit **Apply Changes**. The tool will fetch the new posters and update your Plex library accordingly.

## Usage

- **Interface:**  
  The application is browser-based, so you can access it from any device on your network.

- **Progress Monitoring:**  
  Watch a responsive interface and progress indicators that let you know when poster updates are completed.

  Whether via text queries or time filters, you can quickly narrow down the movies that need fresh posters.
